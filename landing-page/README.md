# JS code explanation 

- I used functions to avoid code redundancy. 
- I used a function to create the navbar.
- I used a function to check if a cretain section is on the viewport of the user.
- I used **document fragment** and then added all the navbar li into it then added it to increase the performance.
- I used *scrollToView* function and read about it to make it scroll smoothly as you asked.
- I used a function to set the navbar item that refers to the section that is on the user's viewport to active.

# CSS code explanation

- I added some styling to the navbar that will be created using **JS as described before**.
- I added a *:hover* property to make some cool effects when you hover your mouse on any item in the navbar.
- I took in consideration that the navbar should be responsive.
- I added *.active* class to style the navbar item that refers to the section that is active on the user's viewport .
- I added *.active-sec* class to style the section that is currently on the user's viewport.

**I didn't make so many changes I Just:**

- Added a new section to make 4 section to fit the requirements. 
  - I gave it an id of section4 so it can be used when I operate on it.
